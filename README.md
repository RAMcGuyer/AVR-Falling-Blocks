# AVR-Falling-Blocks
AVR Falling Blocks is a game that utilizes the AtMega AVR 8-bit micro-controller, as well as the the Nokia5110 LCD screen. The game itself is a simple "dodge the blocks" game. The player must move either left or right to avoid approaching objects, while at the same time they must collect falling hearts to increase their score.
